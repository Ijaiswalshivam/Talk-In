  ```bash

  ```
2. ✍️Make Changes: Work your magic on the codebase. Modify existing files, add new ones, or remove unnecessary ones as needed.
3. 📁Track Changes: After making your modifications, add the changed files to the staging area.
   ```bash
   $ git add .

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "<commit message>"
