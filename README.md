## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, follow the steps
1. üåøBranch Out: Create a new branch with a meaningful name. Branching allows you to work on a separate line of development without affecting the main codebase.
  ```bash
  $ git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
  ```
2. ‚úçÔ∏èMake Changes: Work your magic on the codebase. Modify existing files, add new ones, or remove unnecessary ones as needed.
3. üìÅTrack Changes: After making your modifications, add the changed files to the staging area.
   ```bash
   $ git add .
   ```
4. üööCommit: Commit your changes with a descriptive message that summarizes the changes you've made.
   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "<commit message>"
   ```
5. üöÄPush Changes: Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub. This will allow you to create a pull request from your branch.
   ```bash
   $ git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
   ```
6. üåêCreate Pull Request: Head to GitHub, navigate to your forked repository, and initiate a pull request by clicking "Compare & pull request".
   
   In the pull request description, provide a clear and concise summary of the changes you've made, along with any relevant information or context. This will help the project maintainers understand your 
   contribution and review it more efficiently.
   
   Once you've created the pull request, it will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may request changes, provide feedback, or merge your contribution into the main codebase.
   Remember, this process is essential for contributing to open-source projects on GitHub. Following these steps ensures that your changes are properly tracked, reviewed, and integrated into the project while 
   maintaining code integrity and collaboration.
